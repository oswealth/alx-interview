# N Queens

The “N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard.
To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.
This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.
